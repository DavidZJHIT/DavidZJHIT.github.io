a). Simulated and calculated modified typical h-BCN models by the first principle and got the relevant electromagnetic parameters;     
b). Designed and synthesized a new type of precursor for preparing h-BCN bulk and microtubes;        
c). Synthesized h-BCN bulk and microtubes by precursor-pyrolysis method with outstanding and tunable EMW absorption ability, verified the prediction by calculation. A related paper has been published ***Carbon*** as **the second author (co-first author)**
