*	Proposed a MOF-derived strategy to synthesize hierarchically hollow Zn<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/carbon disks;     
*	Observed Zn<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/carbon constructed by parallelly stacked 2D subunits;     
*	Discovered Zn<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/carbon manifested superior rate capabilities and cycling performance.
