*Abstract*       
Porous C<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> nanofibers are controllably synthesized by a simple two-step method. The prepared samples possess uniform micropores and a chemical composition of C<sub>0.73</sub>N<sub>0.27</sub> with a surface area of 329 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>. The obtained C<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> nanofibers exhibit remarkable electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption properties when compared with conventional one-dimensional carbon materials. The minimum reflection loss (RL) reaches −36 dB at 2.7 GHz when the ratio of the C<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> absorbent added in paraffin matrix is only 1:3. The bandwidth of the RL below −10 dB covers 7.7 GHz (8.1–15.8 GHz) at the sample thickness of 2.5 mm. A possible EM wave loss mechanism was proposed in detail. The multiple reflection and dielectric loss could govern the excellent EM absorption leading the product to a probable application in stealth materials.
