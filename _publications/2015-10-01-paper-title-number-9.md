Main results are highlighted as follows:     
i.	The h-BCN models have been simulated and calculated, indicating these information with the increasing ratio of N in terms of: (1) the increase of the real part (ɛʺ) and the imaginary part (ɛʹ) of the complex permittivity (ɛr = ɛʹ + ɛʺ) at the corresponding EMW range (2-18 GHz), (2) the increase of the electron conductivity (σ) of h-BCN which can be deduced by the changes of the band structures and the densities of states (DOS). By virtue of these features, predictably, the EMW absorption properties of h-BCN can be pretty good and tunable to some degree.      
ii.	A general, facile, yet controllable precursor-polymerization-pyrolysis method is designed for the synthetization of h-BCN bulk derived from commercially available BCl3, ethylenediamine and aniline as the monomers. It is noteworthy that the as-annealed h-BCN bulk, in sharp contrast to magnetic particles absorbents and modified carbon-based absorbents, are ultra-light (15 mg/cm3), highly efficient in EMW absorption (minimum RL value, -52.7 dB at 5.44 GHz).       
iii.	Here, the EMW absorption properties of h-BCN with different atom ratios between C and N have been systemically investigated, showing the reasonable increase of N can attribute to the good performance of EMW absorption (the band widths of RL below -10 dB change from the range of 13.4 to 18 GHz to the range of 2.8 to 18 GHz) and the minimum RL values change to relatively lower frequency (from -20.6 dB at 14.8 GHz to -52.7 dB at 5.44 GHz), agreeing well with calculation results by the first principle.        
iv.	The formation processes and mechanisms of h-BCN bulks and MTs have been systemically studied with different raw-reactant ratios and different heating modes (different highest annealing temperatures and different heating rates), exhibiting the evolution processes of the morphologies. Combined with the formation processes and the microstructural and componential analysis, a possible mechanism of EMW absorption have been proposed as well.
