*Abstract*       
Lithium aluminum silicate (LAS) glass-ceramic exhibits high transmittance to electromagnetic wave and is an ideal radome material. LAS glass-ceramics with different ratios of Li/Al were prepared by sol-gel method. Crystallization behaviors and wave-transparent properties of sintered powders were characterized. β-spodumene was detected as the major phase that precipitated from the sample with 1:1 ratio between Li and Al, which exhibited ultra-low complex permittivity (epsilon, 2.78) and dielectric loss tangent values. The microwave transmittance in 2–18 GHz is higher than 90% when the thickness is within 1.7 mm, suggesting that this kind of LAS glass-ceramic possesses excellent wave-transparent properties.
