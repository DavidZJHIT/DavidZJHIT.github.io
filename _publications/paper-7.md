*Abstract*       
Carbon-based materials have excited extensive interest for their remarkable electrical properties and low density for application in electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbents. However, the processing of heteroatoms doping in carbon nanostructures is an insuperable challenge for attaining effective reflection loss and EM matching. Herein, a facile method for large-scale synthesis of boron and nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes decorated by ferrites particles is proposed. The BCN nanotubes (50–100 nm in diameter) imbedded with nanosized Fe x (B/C/N) y (10–20 nm) are successfully constructed by two steps of polymerization and carbonthermic reduction. The product exhibits an outstanding reflection loss (RL) performance, in that the minimum RL is −47.97 dB at 11.44 GHz with a broad bandwidth 11.2 GHz (from 3.76 to 14.9 GHz) below −10 dB indicating a competitive absorbent in stealth materials. Crystalline and theoretical studies of the absorption mechanism indicate a unique dielectric dispersion effect in the absorbing bandwidth.
